    "HostRestriction": "restricted",
    "Definition": "Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about the range of hosts that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an “affix”, we assume it is restricted."

  {
    "HostRestriction": "semi-restricted",
    "Definition": "Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but rather simply a ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional restrictions). Allows at least two distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of speech categories)"

    "HostRestriction": "restricted: Phrase",
    "Definition": "<don’t use this!> can occur with whatever POS element of that phrase it is adjacent to like Manange NP enclitics--they lean on whatever is last in the NP; used to deal with ‘phrasal affix’-like phenomena"

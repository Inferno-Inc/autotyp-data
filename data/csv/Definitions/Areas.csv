Area,Definition
Alaska-Oregon,Western North America from the coast up to the crest of the major coastal range and from mainland Alaska (not including the Aleutian Islands in the Bering Sea) through the Pacific Northwest down to southern Coos Bay (43° N).
Basin and Plains,"The southwestern desert and semidesert and the prairie, extending into interior northern Canada.  The southern extent needs to be defined; Coahuiltec (which straddles the Texas-Mexico border) has for now been put in this area. Approximate eastern boundary: line from Matamoros/Brownsville or Houston to the Mississippi delta and up the Mississippi to its headwaters, then to the eastern Rocky Mountains foothills at about 58° N.  The western boundary runs along the crest of the major coast range (Sierra Nevada, Cascades), so the area includes the old east slope riverine and lacustrine environment and its immediate periphery."
California,Defined culturally as the area where acorns were the main basis of the economy.  Eastern boundary: the crest of the Sierras.  Northern boundary: Coos Bay (latitude 43° N).  Otherwise congruent with the state of California.
Greater Mesopotamia,"Anatolia, Caucasus, Near East, Mesopotamia, and Iran. From the northern limits of the Black and Caspian seas south to ancient Anatolia (modern Turkey) and Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau. Includes the Arabian peninsula."
E North America,"Southeast and Eastern North America. The Gulf Coast and eastern woodlands.  East of a line from Brownsville/Matamoros at the Mexico/US border to the Mississippi delta and up the Mississippi to its headwaters; from there  to about Fort Nelson (58° N, 122° W)."
NE South America,"The northeast of South America. From the eastern slope of the Andes to the Caribbean and Atlantic coasts (between Caracas and Port of Spain), south to 18° S (this is an arbitrary demarcation of the Amazon and La Plata drainages)."
Europe,"Europe up to the Eurasian steppe. Starting from the Black Sea, the eastern border of Europe follows the eastern slopes of the Carpathian mountains up to about the 22° E and then follows the Wisla up to the Baltic See; and from there we draw a straight line north. (This puts Poland inside Europe, based on its tight historical interaction with the rest of Europe; but one could as well draw the limit following the Oder-Elbe line.)"
Inner Asia,"Inner Siberia and Central Asia: western Turkestan and Afghanistan but not the Iranian plateau, and also the Eastern Eurasian steppe up to the Carpathians; the Tibetan Plateau; Mongolia (inner and outer); most of Siberia."
Indic,"The Indic subcontinent. Extends to the eastern border of the Iranian Plateau in the west, to the south-oriented valleys of the Himalayas, the Karakorum, and the Pamirs and also those of the high-altitude Hindu Kush (but excluding Afghanistan and the Tibetan plateau) in the north, and to the Brahmaputra in the east."
Mesoamerica,The southern boundary is the Panama Canal; the northern boundary is the US/Mexico border. Perhaps this boundary should eventually be placed at the northern limit of the Mesoamerican cultural area.
N Africa,"Northern Africa. North of about 14° N (the latitude of the northern end of Lake Chad and north of the Niger, just north of Khartoum, without Eritrea), but excluding the Ethiopian Plateau (i.e. no farther east than about 35°)."
N Coast Asia,"Coastal Northern Asia. Manchuria, Korea, Japan, and Siberia up to about 100 miles or 160 km inland from the coast. Also including the Aleutian Islands."
Interior New Guinea,The highlands and most of their north slope.
N Coast New Guinea,"Northern coastal New Guinea (up to within about 20 miles of the coast) including the Bird’s Head peninsula; small offshore islands (e.g. Karkar) and the Bismarcks (New Britain, New Ireland) but not the Solomons."
N Australia,Northern Australia. North of 18° S. (This is an artificial boundary and could probably be improved.)
Oceania,"Pacific islands, including the Solomons.  Western boundary is the Wallace Line (about 120° E), so the Philippines, Sulawesi, Flores, Sumba, Timor, etc. are in Oceania."
S Africa,"Southern Africa.  South of about 4.5° N and east of about 10° E.  Includes the rain forest and everything to the south of it. (The northwest corner is just southeast of Cameroon Mountain, or at about Douala, Cameroon. The northeast border is from Mogadishu to the Ethiopian border.)"
S New Guinea,Southern New Guinea. The southern slope and coast.
Southeast Asia,"From the Brahmaputra to near insular Southeast Asia (up to the Wallace Line, between Sumbawa and Flores, thus including Sumatra, Java, and Borneo) and most of China (but not Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia)."
S Australia,Southern Australia. South of 18° S. (This is an artificial boundary and could probably be improved.)
Andean,"Andean South America. The western coast, the Andes, and their eastern slope, south of the border of Panama (about 5° N).  Southern boundary: about 50° S."
African Savannah,"The savannah north of the African rain forest.  Between about 15° N and about 5° N, and east to about 35° E."
Greater Abyssinia,"Between about 5° N and about 17° N, and east of about 35° E  (this line slants up to about 38° E at 17° N).  Includes the Ethiopian plateau and northern Somalia (and could possibly be redrawn to include the Yemen tip of the Arabian peninsula)."
SE South America,"The southeast of South America.  From the eastern slopes of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, south of 18° S.  Includes all of Patagonia and the Gran Chaco, and all of Tierra del Fuego."

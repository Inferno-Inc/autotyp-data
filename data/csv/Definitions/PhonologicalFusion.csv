isolating,isolating,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"The formative is a free phonological word.  If it is, it is likely to be written as a separate word, though this is not always true: non-isolating formatives like clitics are often written as separate words, and isolating formatives are written with hyphens or clitic boundary markers.  Therefore you will need to look at prosodic factors such as word stress."
concatenative,concatenative,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"The formative is a clitic or segmentable affix.  Word-level phonological processes (such as vowel harmony), word-internal kinds of sandhi, prosodic phenomena (such as word stress) or general inability to stand alone, identify a formative as concatenative (rather than an independent word).  Unless there is evidence to the contrary, zeroes are coded as concatenative."
Nonconcatenative,,,,,,"No longer used. Instead, use the more specific type of nonconcatenative marking (Fusion ID #s 5ff). See log #40"
unknown,,,,,,Unknown
isolating_or_concatenative,concatenative,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"Isolating as regards stress, concatenative as regards segmental rules -- or vice versa."
reduplicative,reduplicative,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,A category is marked by some kind of reduplication effect
tonal,tonal,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"A tone contrast marks a morphological contrast.  The tone must be not be the result of a general phonological sandhi rule, but represent true internal tone changes."
concatenative_and_reduplicative,concatenative,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Concatenative formative plus reduplication (usually reduplication of stem).  If some lexemes take just the affix and others take the affix plus the reduplication, choose Concat + redupl and code for lexeme-based formative flexivity.  (The flexivity lies in whether they do or do not take the reduplication part.)"
concatenative_and_ablaut,concatenative,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concatenative formative plus ablaut (usually stem ablaut).
concatenative_or_ablaut,concatenative,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Concatenative formative or ablaut, neither one clearly primary (or both equally primary)."
replacive,replacive,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"The formative replaces a stem (or theme or base) segment. This is different from regularly concatenative formatives which alternate with other formatives, and not with stem segments. Examples: Marxist derived from Marxism (-ism replaces -ist) (Spencer in Spencer & Zwicky, Handbook of Morphology, 140; Oxford, 1998). In Slavic hypocoristics, after truncation, the stem-final consonant is replaced with /x/, e.g. Russ. smex ‘laughter’ < smej- ‘laugh’."
prosodic_templatic,stem,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"Superimposition of a syllable or foot template onto the stem, resulting in such processes as lengthening, gemination etc. Example: Lango alienable possesse marking, Semitic voice marking, etc."
isolating_then_concatenative,concatenative,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"First part of the formative is isolating, second part is concatenative."
concatenative_then_isolating,concatenative,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"First part of the formative is concatenative, second part is isolating."
tonal_or_ablaut_then_isolating,stem,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"First part of the formative is a tonal or ablaut alternation; second part is isolating. Example: Kisi negation, where the verb stem undergoes tone changes and a particle is added (Childs, A Grammar of Kisi, 220ff.; Mouton de Gruyter 1995."
suppletive,stem,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,One root or morpheme replaces another in part of a paradigm.
lenition,stem,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Alternation in one or more consonant features
ablaut,stem,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Alternation of stem segments in some grammatical context.  Distinct from phonologically conditioned alternation.
concatenative_default_or_isolating,concatenative,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Concatenative formative is default; isolating allomorph under certain conditions.
isolating_default_or_concatenative,isolating,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,Isolating formative is default; concatenative allomorph under certain conditions.
mixed,,,,,,"This value is used only for survey purposes. Do not use when inputting data. When inputting data, choose a specific value or <?>."
distributed,stem,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"There are realizational traces of the category on several or even all morphemes in a string, and none of these seem more basic (so that others could be analyzed as category-triggered allomorphs. Good example: Semitic root&pattern morphology, where for TAM+DIATHESIS values it seems abritrary to either take the stem ablaut or the affix form as basic. They code TAM+DIATHESIS simultaneously."
concatenative_or_suppletive,,,,,,"Concatenative formative or suppletion, under different conditions."
tonal_or_suppletive,,,,,,"Tonal formative or suppletion, under different conditions."
ablaut_or_suppletive,,,,,,"Ablaut or suppletion, under different conditions."
concatenative_or_tonal,,,,,,"Concatenative or tonal formative, under different conditions."

HostRestriction,Definition
restricted,"Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about the range of hosts that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an “affix”, we assume it is restricted."
semi-restricted,"Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but rather simply a ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional restrictions). Allows at least two distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of speech categories)"
unrestricted,occurs with anything (e.g. Turkish mi)
,not applicable
unknown,degree of restriction unknown at this time
Part circum/simulfix,even more restricted than restricted; used with simulfixation & circumfixation
restricted: Head,<don’t use this!> VERY RESTRICTED something like affix only to a head element (in a narrowed sense of RestrID 1)
restricted: Phrase,<don’t use this!> can occur with whatever POS element of that phrase it is adjacent to like Manange NP enclitics--they lean on whatever is last in the NP; used to deal with ‘phrasal affix’-like phenomena

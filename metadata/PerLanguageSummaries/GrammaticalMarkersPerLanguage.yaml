      In this database a language is actually a dialect or variety, in that
      individual dialects are entered as languages. That is, each language has
      its own ID number (the 'LID') distinct from that of the pan-dialectal
      language:e.g. LID 87 German, 1227 Upper Austrian German, 1295 Berlin
      German, 1310 Zürich German, 2845 Old High German, etc. (The pan-dialectal
      language is identified as the lowest taxonomic level, the `dialect group',
      but this information is incomplete in many areas and has not been included
      in the current release.) The general criterion for a separate language
      record in the database is that it has a distinct property in at least one
      of the typological variables that we survey; this may or may not coincide
      with sociolinguistic criteria.

      Value of `GrammaticalMarkers::MarkerMorphemeType` for exemplar "Case"
    kind: computed data (aggregation-scripts/GrammaticalMarkers.R)
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "formative": >-
        Marker of a category that cannot occur as an independent part of speech unit in
        the syntax, but instead grammatically requires some host.
      "PoSWd": >-
        A syntactic unit that has its own part of speech (PoS) category. Depending on the
        diversity of grammatical words (g-word) in a language (see “word_type” database),
        this may or may not coincide with the g-word defined as ‘terminal node’. If g-
        word domains differ, “PoSWd” as used here refers to the one domain that has
        a PoS label attached to it. What counts is the syntactic behavior, e.g. if an
        element behaves like a verb but is defective morphologically, it still has the
        PoS label ‘verb’ (see for example Quileute negation ‘é’, which behaves like a verb
        syntactically even thought its inflectional paradigm is defective).
      "any": >-
        A unit that can be used both as a formative or as PoSWd, e.g. SEA versatile verbs/
        coverbs
      "SemiWd": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Semiwords have some but not all the syntactic properties of
        ordinary SynWds. Typical examples of semiwords are incorpated nouns and verbs,
        as well as seperated preverbs and other particles that belong to a verbal lexeme.
        SemiWds belong to the same grammatical word as their host, and together with their
        host, they constitute an X-zero category in phrase-structure. But they retain some
        syntactic properties such as valence or PoS.
      "unknown": >-
        type is unknown at this time
      "Restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific stem or phrasal host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "Semi-restricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to a number of
        specific stem ot phrasal host categories (e.g. only to noun and verb stems).
      "Unrestricted Formative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an inflectional category that cannot occur
        as an independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches
        indiscriminately to a any non-stem host available (words or phrases). Unrestricted
        formatives are traditionally called “particles” or “clitics”, but these terms
        are also used in other senses. Unrestricted formatives differ from PoSWds in that
        they attach to some host and cannot appear on their own, or establish their own
        independent part of speech element in the syntax.
      "Restricted derivative": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE! Marker of an derivational category that cannot occur as an
        independent part of speech unit in the syntax, but instead attaches to one and
        only specific host category (e.g. only to noun stems)
      "stem": >-
        A morphological constituent that obligatorily combines with formatives (possibly
        zero) and derivatives and determines the part of speech of this combination (e.g.
        a noun stem that combines with case formatives to produce nouns). A stem differs
        from a PosWd in that a stem determines the PoS of the word to which it belongs,
        but it does not constitute a PoS on its own. ‘Stem” means entire stems, if only
        parts are refered to, use MphmType ID 13 ‘Stem Part’
      "stem part": >-
        An element of a stem (as defined under ID 12) that is not delimited by general
        extramorphological (prosodic, syntactic) principles. Typical example: the
        constituents of bipartite stems
      "root": >-
        An element of a stem that behaves differently from a stem. Only use when there is
        a difference in the language. Most languages do not differentiate stem and root

        Is restricted to a specific type of host. When descriptions are silent about
        the range of hosts that a marker can combine with, but analyze the marker as an
        “affix”, we assume it is restricted.
      "semi-restricted": >-
        Can occur with some, but not all host elements (so, NOT a ‘phrasal affix’, but
        rather simply a ‘particle’-like formative that has some degree of selectional
        restrictions). Allows at least two distinct hosts (in terms of their parts of
        speech categories)
      "unrestricted": >-
        occurs with anything (e.g. Turkish mi)
      "unknown": >-

      "restricted: Head": >-
        <don’t use this!> VERY RESTRICTED something like affix only to a head element (in

    kind: computed data (aggregation-scripts/GrammaticalMarkers.R)
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "isolating": >-
        The formative is a free phonological word. If it is, it is likely to be written
        as a separate word, though this is not always true: non-isolating formatives like
        clitics are often written as separate words, and isolating formatives are written
        with hyphens or clitic boundary markers. Therefore you will need to look at
        prosodic factors such as word stress.
      "concatenative": >-
        The formative is a clitic or segmentable affix. Word-level phonological processes
        (such as vowel harmony), word-internal kinds of sandhi, prosodic phenomena (such
        as word stress) or general inability to stand alone, identify a formative as
        concatenative (rather than an independent word). Unless there is evidence to the
        contrary, zeroes are coded as concatenative.
      "Nonconcatenative": >-
        No longer used. Instead, use the more specific type of nonconcatenative marking
        (Fusion ID #s 5ff). See log #40
      "unknown": >-
        Unknown
      "isolating_or_concatenative": >-
        Isolating as regards stress, concatenative as regards segmental rules -- or vice
        versa.
      "reduplicative": >-
        A category is marked by some kind of reduplication effect
      "tonal": >-
        A tone contrast marks a morphological contrast. The tone must be not be the result
        of a general phonological sandhi rule, but represent true internal tone changes.
      "concatenative_and_reduplicative": >-
        Concatenative formative plus reduplication (usually reduplication of stem). If
        some lexemes take just the affix and others take the affix plus the reduplication,
        choose Concat + redupl and code for lexeme-based formative flexivity. (The
        flexivity lies in whether they do or do not take the reduplication part.)
      "concatenative_and_ablaut": >-
        Concatenative formative plus ablaut (usually stem ablaut).
      "concatenative_or_ablaut": >-
        Concatenative formative or ablaut, neither one clearly primary (or both equally
        primary).
      "replacive": >-
        The formative replaces a stem (or theme or base) segment. This is different from
        regularly concatenative formatives which alternate with other formatives, and
        not with stem segments. Examples: Marxist derived from Marxism (-ism replaces
        -ist) (Spencer in Spencer & Zwicky, Handbook of Morphology, 140; Oxford, 1998).
        In Slavic hypocoristics, after truncation, the stem-final consonant is replaced
        with /x/, e.g. Russ. smex ‘laughter’ < smej- ‘laugh’.
      "prosodic_templatic": >-
        Superimposition of a syllable or foot template onto the stem, resulting in such
        processes as lengthening, gemination etc. Example: Lango alienable possesse
        marking, Semitic voice marking, etc.
      "isolating_then_concatenative": >-
        First part of the formative is isolating, second part is concatenative.
      "concatenative_then_isolating": >-
        First part of the formative is concatenative, second part is isolating.
      "tonal_or_ablaut_then_isolating": >-
        First part of the formative is a tonal or ablaut alternation; second part is
        isolating. Example: Kisi negation, where the verb stem undergoes tone changes and
        a particle is added (Childs, A Grammar of Kisi, 220ff.; Mouton de Gruyter 1995.
      "suppletive": >-
        One root or morpheme replaces another in part of a paradigm.
      "lenition": >-
        Alternation in one or more consonant features
      "ablaut": >-
        Alternation of stem segments in some grammatical context. Distinct from
        phonologically conditioned alternation.
      "concatenative_default_or_isolating": >-
        Concatenative formative is default; isolating allomorph under certain conditions.
      "isolating_default_or_concatenative": >-
        Isolating formative is default; concatenative allomorph under certain conditions.
      "mixed": >-
        This value is used only for survey purposes. Do not use when inputting data. When
        inputting data, choose a specific value or <?>.
      "distributed": >-
        There are realizational traces of the category on several or even all morphemes
        in a string, and none of these seem more basic (so that others could be analyzed
        as category-triggered allomorphs. Good example: Semitic root&pattern morphology,
        where for TAM+DIATHESIS values it seems abritrary to either take the stem ablaut
        or the affix form as basic. They code TAM+DIATHESIS simultaneously.
      "concatenative_or_suppletive": >-
        Concatenative formative or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "tonal_or_suppletive": >-
        Tonal formative or suppletion, under different conditions.
      "ablaut_or_suppletive": >-

        Inert and at the end of its domain (e.g. at the end of the clause for TAM markers,
        or at the end of the NP for case markers)
      "initial": >-
        Inert and at the beginning (first element) of its domain (e.g. at the first
        element of the clause for TAM markers, or at the beginning of the NP for case
        markers). Combined with a “post” value in position, a “following” value in
        Placement, and freedom of hosts, this is a typical Wackernagel clitic.
      "on head": >-
        Inert and positioned on the head of its domain: V for TAM, N for case. This
        is typical for suffixes. Since clitics are typically insensitive to the host
        category, their placement is regulated by more abstract positions (initial, final,
        penultimate, pre-initial etc.) rather than the head. “On head” is used only with
        phrases where the head can vary its position.
      "on preceding": >-
        DO NOT USE ANYMORE. If an element precedes its host, e.g. if a case enclitic
        attaches to the preceding word, this is coded (following Klavans 1985) as
        placement = preceding and behavior = on head (or spreading or initial or whatever
        the case may be).
      "flexible": >-
        Inert and freely positioned within its domain (ie. position is not defined with
        respect to H or D but by something else).
      "lex. positioned": >-
        Once per phrase; whether on head or dependent is lexically determined. Example:
        Wemba Wemba dual and plural, which are overt on the noun unless there is a
        demonstrative pronoun; then it takes the dual or plural form and the noun does
        not.
      "on head and final": >-
        Simultaneously on head and final.
      "on head and initial": >-
        Simultaneously on head and initial.
      "on head or final": >-
        Data inconclusive because all heads in the grammar happen to be final.

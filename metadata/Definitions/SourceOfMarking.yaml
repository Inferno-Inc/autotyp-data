        The formative is there because of government, i.e. it is assigned by a head, i.e.
        it is specified by a head’s valence.
      "agree": >-
        The formative is there because of agreement.

        In most contexts, use of the formative is the speaker’s choice. But to the degree
        that the formative is inflectional, there are some grammatical environments where
        the use is compulsory (e.g. sequence of tenses.)
      "free/agree": >-
        TODO
      "agr-target": >-
        the formative agrees, but that is not the reason of its presence, i.e. it is
        present for some other reason, e.g. derivation (unlike the type we call “agree”).

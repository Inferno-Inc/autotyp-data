  Continent:
    description: >-
      Continent-sized macroarea, based on our assumptions about contact events
      in history, informed by current knowledge of the historical, genetic,
      anthropological, and archeological record. All macro-areas are visualized
      in the files continents.jpg and continents.kml available on this
      repository.
    kind: manual data entry
    data: value-list
    values: 
      "Africa": >-
        All of Africa.
      "W and SW Eurasia": >-
        Western and Southwestern Eurasia. Including the Caucasus and following the
        northern shore of the Black Sea and the Carpathians to the Baltic sea. Also
        includes the languages of Ancient Anatolia and Mesopotamia east to the Hindu Kush
        (including the Iranian plateau).
      "N-C Asia": >-
        Northern and Central Asia. Siberia, the Tibetan plateau, Mongolia, Korea, and
        Japan.
      "S/SE Asia": >-
        South and Southeast Asia. The Indic subcontinent (including the Himalayas, but not
        the Tibetan plateau), mainland Southeast Asia, and insular Southeast Asia up to
        the Wallace Line (between Sumbawa and Flores).
      "Australia": >-
        All of Australia.
      "NG and Oceania": >-
        New Guinea and Oceania (all islands east of the Wallace Line).
      "W N America": >-
        Western North America. From the Pacific coast (excluding the Aleutian islands,
        including only mainland Alaska) to the lower eastern slope of the major coastal
        range (Cascades, Rocky Mountains), thus comprising the coastal and intermontane
        regions. The southern boundary of North America runs along the US/Mexican border.
      "E N America": >-
        Eastern North America. From the lower eastern slope of the Cascades and Rocky
        Mountains to the Atlantic coast (thus comprising the Great Plains and eastern US
        and Canada). The southern boundary runs along the US/Mexican border; perhaps this
        boundary should eventually be placed at the northern limit of the Mesoamerican
        cultural area.
      "C America": >-
        Central America. The southern boundary is the Panama Canal; the northern boundary
        is the U.S.-Mexico border. Perhaps this boundary should eventually be placed at
        the northern limit of the Mesoamerican cultural area.
      "S America": >-
        All of South America.

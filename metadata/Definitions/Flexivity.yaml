      "cat-based": >-
        Allomorphic variation determined by the choice of inflectional category (e.g., a
        certain stem ablaut in certain tense forms, across the regular lexicon)
      "lex-based": >-
        Allomorphic variation determined by the choice of lexical host (e.g., a certain
        stem ablaut with some verbs, but not with others)
      "none": >-
        No allomorphic variation
      "both": >-
        Allomorphic variation determined by both the inflectional category and the lexical
        host
      "free": >-
        Free allomorphic variation

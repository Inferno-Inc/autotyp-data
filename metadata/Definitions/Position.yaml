      Position of grammatical marker with regard to its phonological host

        the formative has two exponents at different positions in the phonological host
        (but it is not the case that one is positioned before and the other after the
        host, which is coded as “circum”)

        the formative has two exponents, one before and one after the phonological host.
        This is a special case of the “simul” position
